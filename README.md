# NTU-OOP-2021
NTU-Object Oriented Programming Language

## Abstract
This is the final project of OOP, implementing simplified Taiwan High Speed Rail booking system using java. It simulates two core functionalities:
- **Search System**: Filter trains based on user-specified criteria (e.g. ticket type, car type, train number, time range, seat availibility) and returns a matching timetable.
- **Booking System**: Allows users to reserve seats on specific trains with detailed input options (e.g. departure/arrival station, car type, ticket type).

Train schedules and seat availibility are mangaed using a JSON-based file database, making the system lightweight and easy to modify.

This repo is contributed by Kevin Lin, 何耕頡, 劉正德 and me.
